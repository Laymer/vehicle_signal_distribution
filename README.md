# VEHICLE SIGNAL DISTRIBUTION [VSD]
Library to publish and subscribe Vehicle Signal Specification signals
via reliab le multicast.


VSD reads a signal specification CSV file, generated from the GENIVI
Vehicle Signal Specification project, and provides API calls to
set, publish, subscribe, and receive to these signals.

Please see [Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS)](https://github.com/GENIVI/vehicle_signal_specification)
project for details on branches, signal structures and attributes.

Below is an overview of how signals are structured.
![VSS Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PDXostc/vehicle_signal_distribution/documentation/illustrations/vsd_overview.png "Vehicle Signal Specification Overview")
*Fig 1. Vehicle Signal Specification Overview*

**Branches** host other branches and signals and form an overall signal structure.<br>
**Sensors** contain signals read from actual sensors and signals
calculated from multiple sensor sources.<br>
**Attributes** are static values containing configuration-level data.<br>

A signal\'s value is set and published as two separate operations.

Publishing can be done on an individual signal level, or on a branch
level. If a branch is published, the branch and all its children are
published in an atomic operation. This allows complex signal
structures to be easily transmitted.

Subscriptions can also be done an signal or on a branch level. If a
branch is subscribed to, a callback will be made for any signal that
is updated under that branch.

## Using Vehicle Signal Distribution:
Be sure that you have built and deployed libraries for both dstc and
reliable_multicast (RMC), as they are dependencies of the vsd project.

The libraries can be found at:

[Reliable Multicast v1.3](https://github.com/PDXostc/reliable_multicast/releases/tag/v1.3)<br>
[DSTC v1.2](https://github.com/PDXostc/dstc/releases/tag/v1.2)<br>

Build and install RMC first, followed by DSTC, and ensure that
`Makefile` has include and link paths setup to the install
directories.

VSD currently will produce a shared object to link against, and also
compiles two example programs to begin working with the project. Build
and install these using:

    make
    make DESTDIR=/usr/local install

## RUNNING THE EXAMPLE
The programs `vsd_pub_example` and `vsd_sub_examples` are built and
installed, providing an insight into how VSD works.

## Running `vsd_sub_example`
The usage for `vsd_sub_example`, which subscribes to signals sent
by `vsd_pub_example` is shown below.

     ./vsd_sub_example /usr/local/share/vss_rel_2.0.0-alpha+005.csv Vehicle.Drivetrain.InternalCombustionEngine

The first argument, `/usr/local/share/vss_rel_2.0-alpha+005.csv` is a
CSV variant of the vehicle signal specifiation generated by running
`make` in a checked out VSS repo. It contains a tree structure of all
signals, their type, allowed values, if they are actuators, sensors,
or others, etc. VSD uses this as a global specification of all signals
that can possibly be seen on the network, even if not all of them are
supported in a given deployment.

All VSD nodes must load the same version of the file in order to have
the definition of signals.

A sample VSS csv file is installed under the `share` directory of the
VSD install directory.

The second argument, `Vehicle.Drivetrain.InternalCombustionEngine`,
specifies the subtree that is to be subscribed to. If any signal in
the given subtree is received, a callback will be made to the
subscriber. This allows the subscriber to chose the granularity of the
subscription, from individual signals to the whole vehicle state.

## Running `vsd_pub_example`
The usage for `vsd_pub_example`, which publishes signals to
zero or more `vsd_sub_example` instances network, is shown below.

    vsd_pub_example -d /usr/local/share/vss_rel_2.0.0-alpha+005.csv \
                    -s Vehicle.Drivetrain.InternalCombustionEngine.Engine.Power:230 \
                    -s Vehicle.Drivetrain.InternalCombustionEngine.FuelType:gasoline \
                    -p Vehicle.Drivetrain.InternalCombustionEngine

The `-d /usr/local/share/vss_rel_2.0.0-alpha+005.csv` argument
specifies where to load the signal specification file from. This file
must be the same as that used by `vsd_sub_example`.

The `-s Vehicle.Drivetrain.InternalCombustionEngine.Engine.Power:230`
argument sets the value of the `Power` signal for the engine to `230`.

The `-s Vehicle.Drivetrain.InternalCombustionEngine.FuelTyoe:gasoline`
argument sets the value of the `FuelTyoe` signal for the engine to `gasoline`.

The `-p Vehicle.Drivetrain.InternalCombustionEngine`
argument specifies that all signals under the `InternalCombustionEngine` should be published
atomically.

Atomic signal publishing allows for the transmission of arbitrarily
complex signals as a single, cohesive unit.  The callback will receive
a list of all the published signals, which represents a snapshot of
the published tree at that exact moment in time.

## API CALL FLOW - PUBLISHER
The call flow for the publisher is illustrated below. Please note that
the calls shown have slight name and argument variations in the
implementation. Please see the sample code in `vsd_pub_example.c` and
`vsd_sub_example.c` for further details.


The signals this example are simplified down to two sensors, RPM
(engine speed), ECT (engine coolant temperature), and one attribute,
FuelType.

*Fig 2. Signal Publisher overview*

### Loading VSS signal descriptor file

The VSD system is hosted by a context variable that is setup by the library.
In order to initialize VSD, a pointer to a `vsd_context_t` pointer is provided
to `vsd_load_from_file()` together with the VSS file to load.

    vsd_context_t* ctx = 0;
    vsd_load_from_file(&ctx, "vss_2.0.0.csv");

The `vss_2.0.0.csv` file is generated by the VSS project (link in
introduction). Please note that the loaded CSV file needs to have
signal IDs for branches, not only the signals themselves.  To verify
if this is the case, check that the second field in the CSV has a
number (in quotes) for each line.

### Setting the first signal

The signal publisher starts the process of distributing updated signal values to subscribers by setting a signal through a VSD call:

![Publisher step 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PDXostc/vehicle_signal_distribution/documentation/illustrations/vsd_pub_2.png "Setting the first signal")
*Fig 3. Setting the first signal*

A signal value can be set by its name (slow), its unique signal ID integer (less slow), or by a signal descriptor retrieved by name or ID (fast). In the example above we set the signal by name, which is a complete VSS path to the signal.

The signal value is changed from its original 2350 to 2400.

### Setting the second signal
Additional signals can subsequently be set by the publisher:

![Publisher step 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PDXostc/vehicle_signal_distribution/documentation/illustrations/vsd_pub_3.png "Setting the second signal")
*Fig 4. Setting the second signal*

In this case we change ECT from 89 to 94 degrees (Centigrade). We can
set an arbitrary number of signals, and also set the same signal
multiple times.


### Publishing a signal subtree
Once all signals have been updated they can be published. Publishing is can be done on an individual signal level or on a branch level as shown below.

![Publisher step 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PDXostc/vehicle_signal_distribution/documentation/illustrations/vsd_pub_4.png "Publishing signals")
*Fig 5. Publishing signals*

In this case all signals hosted by the Engine branch, ECT, RPM, and FuelType, will be publsihed. Please note that FuelType is included although it has not been updated. There will be an option to specify if unchanged signals should be published or not.

An individual signal can be published by simply specifying the full VSS path to it:

    vsd_publish("Engine.RPM");


### Transmitting published signals over the network.
the `vsd_publish` call will pack up all signals hosted by the specified branch (or a specifically referenced signal) and send it out via the network:

![Publisher step 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PDXostc/vehicle_signal_distribution/documentation/illustrations/vsd_pub_5.png "Transmitting signals")
*Fig 5. Transmitting signals*

Signals are transmitted via a call to DSTC (see dependencies chapter for a link) and will ultimately be sent via UDP/IP multicast to all nodes in the network subscribing on the same multicast IP and port.
The multicast packet hosting the signal is reliable and will be resent if the UDP packet is dropped. See Reliable Multicast for more information.

All subscribers will read the transmitted signals and process them as described below.

## API CALL FLOW - SUBSCRIBER
The call flow for the subscriber is illustrated below.

### Loading VSS signal descriptor file
Th subscriber loads the CSS CSV file in the same way as the publisher.
